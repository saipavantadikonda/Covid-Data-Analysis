### Introduction

COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by the novel Corona virus and it is a continuing worldwide pandemic. There have been over 130 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally. In this project we will try to understand the underlying patterns in the spread of the covid-19 virus by using the data provided by usafacts.org (Cases, Deaths and population) and with the four enrichment datasets (Census Demographic ACS, ACS Social Economic and Housing, Employment Dataset and Presidential election results).


### Project Goal

We as a team plan to analyze the covid-19 data provided by usafacts.org along with the enrichment datasets and provide some meaningful statistics which would help us to understand the underlying patterns of the covid-19 spread and also to develop a analytical framework which helps us to study the covid-19 effects.
